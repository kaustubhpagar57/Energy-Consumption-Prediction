# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

This project focuses on the energy consumption of electrical appliances which are normally used in a low energy consumption house. An IOT based Wireless Sensor is used to track the temperature and humidity conditions of the rooms of the house which are used to predict the electrical consumption of the house appliances. It is also significantly impacted by the weather conditions. In this paper, we try to predict the energy consumption of the appliances using various regression analysis models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor(SVR), K-Neighbors Regressor and so on.
